Tutorials and resources {#doc_community_tutorials}
=======================

This is a list of third-party tutorials and resources created by the
Godot community. For resources, remember that there is the official
[Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset) full
of official and community resources too! Also have a look at this [huge
list over at
Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/an0iq5/godot_tutorials_list_of_video_and_written/).

Think there is something missing here? Feel free to submit a [Pull

as always.

[Game from
Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDEcP8Mc-7s&list=PLS9MbmO_ssyDk79j9ewONxV88fD5e_o5d)
and

introduction to beginners.

If you\'re interested in Visual Scripting, [Emilio\'s
