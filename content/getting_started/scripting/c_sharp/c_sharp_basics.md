Warning
:::

C\# support is a new feature available since Godot 3.0. As such, you may
still run into some issues, or find spots where the documentation could
be improved. Please report issues with C\# in Godot on the [engine
GitHub page](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues), and any
documentation issues on the [documentation GitHub
page](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/issues).
:::

This page provides a brief introduction to C\#, both what it is and how
to use it in Godot. Afterwards, you may want to look at
`how to use specific features <doc_c_sharp_features>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, read about the
`differences between the C# and the GDScript API <doc_c_sharp_differences>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and (re)visit the
`Scripting section <doc_scripting>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} of the
step-by-step tutorial.

C\# is a high-level programming language developed by Microsoft. In
Godot, it is implemented with the Mono 6.x .NET framework, including
full support for C\# 8.0. Mono is an open source implementation of
Microsoft\'s .NET Framework based on the ECMA standards for C\# and the
Common Language Runtime. A good starting point for checking its
capabilities is the
[Compatibility](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/compatibility/)
page in the Mono documentation.

Note

This is **not** a full-scale tutorial on the C\# language as a whole. If
you aren\'t already familiar with its syntax or features, see the
[Microsoft C\#
guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/index) or look for
a suitable introduction elsewhere.
:::

Setting up C\# for Godot
------------------------

### Windows

Download and install the latest version of [Visual
Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (*not* Visual
Studio Code), which contains utilities required to use C\# in Godot. If
you don\'t plan on using the Visual Studio IDE, you can download just
the [Visual Studio Build
Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=15)
instead. Make sure you at least have the .NET Framework 4.5 targeting
pack installed, you can get it using any of the installers mentioned
above inside the \"Individual components\" tab.

### macOS and Linux

Download and install the latest version of the [Mono
SDK](http://www.mono-project.com/download/). As of Godot 3.1 beta 3, the
version number doesn\'t matter since Godot bundles its own Mono 5.18
installation. We only need the Mono installation for NuGet and MSBuild
which are required to use C\# in Godot.

Note
:::

To download Mono on macOS, use the \"Stable Channel\" link from the
[Mono Downloads Page](http://www.mono-project.com/download/). The Visual
Studio channel is an earlier version of Mono and will not work.
:::

### Additional notes

Your Godot version must have Mono support enabled, so make sure to
download the **Mono version** of Godot. If you are building Godot from
source, make sure to follow the steps to enable Mono support in your
build as outlined in the `doc_compiling_with_mono`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} page.

In summary, you must have installed Visual Studio or Mono (depending on
your operating system) **and** the Mono-enabled version of Godot.

Configuring an external editor
------------------------------

C\# support in Godot\'s script editor is minimal. Consider using an
external IDE or editor, such as [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or MonoDevelop. These provide
autocompletion, debugging, and other useful features for C\#. To select
an external editor in Godot, click on **Editor â†’ Editor Settings** and
scroll down to **Mono**. Under **Mono**, click on **Editor**, and select
your external editor of choice. Godot currently supports the following
external editors:

-   Visual Studio 2019
-   Visual Studio Code
-   MonoDevelop
-   Visual Studio for Mac
-   JetBrains Rider

If you are using Visual Studio Code, ensure you download and install the
[C\#
extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp)
to enable features like syntax highlighting and IntelliSense.

If you are using Visual Studio 2019, you must follow the instructions
found in the \"Configure VS2019 for Debugging\" section below.

Creating a C\# script
---------------------

After you successfully set up C\# for Godot, you should see the
following option when selecting `Attach script` in the context menu of a
node in your scene:

![image](img/attachcsharpscript.png)

Note that while some specifics change, most concepts work the same when
using C\# for scripting. If you\'re new to Godot, you may want to follow
the tutorials on `doc_scripting`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} at this
point. While some places in the documentation still lack C\# examples,
most concepts can be transferred easily from GDScript.

Project setup and workflow
--------------------------

When you create the first C\# script, Godot initializes the C\# project
files for your Godot project. This includes generating a C\# solution
(`.sln`) and a project file (`.csproj`), as well as some utility files
and folders (`.mono` and `Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs`). All of these but
`.mono` are important and should be committed to your version control
system. `.mono` can be safely added to the ignore list of your VCS. When
troubleshooting, it can sometimes help to delete the `.mono` folder and
let it regenerate.

Note that currently, there are some issues where Godot and the C\#
project don\'t stay in sync; if you delete, rename or move a C\# script,
the change may not be reflected in the C\# project file. In cases like
this, you will have to edit the C\# project file manually.

For example, if you created a script (e.g. `Test.cs`) and delete it in
Godot, compilation will fail because the missing file is still expected
to be there by the C\# project file. For now, you can simply open up the
`.csproj` file and look for the `ItemGroup`, there should be a line
included like the following:

``` {.sourceCode .xml}
<ItemGroup>
    <Compile Include="Test.cs" />
    <Compile Include="AnotherTest.cs" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Simply remove that line and your project should build correctly again.
Same for renaming and moving things, simply rename and move them in the
project file if needed.

Example
-------

Here\'s a blank C\# script with some comments to demonstrate how it
works.

``` {.sourceCode .csharp}
using Godot;
using System;

public class YourCustomClass : Node
{
    // Member variables here, example:
    private int a = 2;
    private string b = "textvar";

    public override void _Ready()
    {
        // Called every time the node is added to the scene.
        // Initialization here.
        GD.Print("Hello from C# to Godot :)");
    }

    public override void _Process(float delta)
    {
        // Called every frame. Delta is time since the last frame.
        // Update game logic here.
    }
}
```

As you can see, functions normally in global scope in GDScript like
Godot\'s `print` function are available in the `GD` class which is part
of the `Godot` namespace. For a list of methods in the `GD` class, see
the class reference pages for
`@GDScript <class_@gdscript>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`@GlobalScope <class_@globalscope>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

::: {.note}
::: {.admonition-title}
Note
:::

Keep in mind that the class you wish to attach to your node should have
the same name as the `.cs` file. Otherwise, you will get the following
error and won\'t be able to run the scene: *\"Cannot find class XXX for
script res://XXX.cs\"*
:::

General differences between C\# and GDScript
--------------------------------------------

The C\# API uses `PascalCase` instead of `snake_case` in GDScript/C++.
Where possible, fields and getters/setters have been converted to
properties. In general, the C\# Godot API strives to be as idiomatic as
is reasonably possible.

For more information, see the
`doc_c_sharp_differences`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} page.

Current gotchas and known issues
--------------------------------

As C\# support is quite new in Godot, there are some growing pains and
things that need to be ironed out. Below is a list of the most important
issues you should be aware of when diving into C\# in Godot, but if in
doubt, also take a look over the official [issue tracker for Mono
issues](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/labels/topic%3Amono).

-   As explained above, the C\# project isn\'t always kept in sync
    automatically when things are deleted, renamed or moved in Godot
    ([\#12917](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/12917)).
-   Writing editor plugins is possible, but it is currently quite
    convoluted.
-   State is currently not saved and restored when hot-reloading, with
    the exception of exported variables.
-   Exporting Mono projects is only supported for desktop platforms
    (Linux, Windows and macOS). Android, iOS, HTML5 and UWP are not
    currently supported
    ([\#20267](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/20267),
    [\#20268](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/20268)
    [\#20270](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/20270)
    [\#20271](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/20271)).
-   Attached C\# scripts should refer to a class that has a class name
    that matches the file name.
-   There are some methods such as `Get()`/`Set()`,
    `Call()`/`CallDeferred()` and signal connection method `Connect()`
    that rely on Godot\'s `snake_case` API naming conventions. So when
    using e.g. `CallDeferred("AddChild")`, `AddChild` will not work
    because the API is expecting the original `snake_case` version
    `add_child`. However, you can use any custom properties or methods
    without this limitation.

Performance of C\# in Godot
---------------------------

According to some preliminary
[benchmarks](https://github.com/cart/godot3-bunnymark), the performance
of C\# in Godot --- while generally in the same order of magnitude ---
is roughly **\~4Ã—** that of GDScript in some naive cases. C++ is still a
little faster; the specifics are going to vary according to your use
case. GDScript is likely fast enough for most general scripting
workloads. C\# is faster, but requires some expensive marshalling when
talking to Godot.

Using NuGet packages in Godot
-----------------------------

[NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) packages can be installed and used with
Godot, as with any C\# project. Many IDEs are able to add packages
directly. They can also be added manually by adding the package
reference in the `.csproj` file located in the project root:

``` {.sourceCode .xml}
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json">
      <Version>11.0.2</Version>
    </PackageReference>
</ItemGroup>
...
```

> \</Project\>

::: {.note}
::: {.admonition-title}
Note
:::

By default, tools like NuGet put `Version` as an attribute of the
`` `PackageReference ``\` Node. **You must manually create a Version
node as shown above.** This is because the version of MSBuild used
requires this. (This will be fixed in Godot 4.0.)
:::

Whenever packages are added or modified, run `nuget restore` (*not*
`dotnet restore`) in the root of the project directory. To ensure that
NuGet packages will be available for msbuild to use, run:

``` {.sourceCode .none}
msbuild /t:restore
```

Profiling your C\# code
-----------------------

-   [Mono log
    profiler](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/debug+profile/profile/profiler/)
    is available for Linux and macOS. Due to a Mono change, it does not
    work on Windows currently.
-   External Mono profiler like [JetBrains
    dotTrace](https://www.jetbrains.com/profiler/) can be used as
    described [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/34382).

Configuring VS 2019 for debugging
---------------------------------

::: {.note}
::: {.admonition-title}
Note
:::

Godot has built-in support for workflows involving several popular C\#
IDEs. Built-in support for Visual Studio will be including in future
versions, but in the meantime, the steps below can let you configure VS
2019 for use with Godot C\# projects.
:::

1.  Install VS 2019 with `.NET desktop development` and
    `Desktop development with C++` workloads selected.
2.  **Ensure that you do not have Xamarin installed.** Do not choose the
    `Mobile development with .NET` workload. Xamarin changes the DLLs
    used by MonoDebugger, which breaks debugging.
3.  Install the [VSMonoDebugger
    extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GordianDotNet.VSMonoDebugger0d62).
4.  In VS 2019 \--\> Extensions \--\> Mono \--\> Settings:
    -   Select `Debug/Deploy to local Windows`.
    -   Leave `Local Deploy Path` blank.
    -   Set the `Mono Debug Port` to the port in Godot \--\> Project
        \--\> Project Settings \--\> Mono \--\> Debugger Agent.
    -   Also select `Wait for Debugger` in the Godot Mono options. [This
        Godot Addon](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/435)
        may be helpful.
5.  Run the game in Godot. It should hang at the Godot splash screen
    while it waits for your debugger to attach.
6.  In VS 2019, open your project and choose Extensions \--\> Mono \--\>
    Attach to Mono Debugger.
