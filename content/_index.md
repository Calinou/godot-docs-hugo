This documentation is translated from the [original English
one](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest) by community members on
[Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/godot-engine/godot-docs).

Depending on the translation effort\'s completion level, you may find
paragraphs or whole pages which are still in English. You can help the
community by providing new translations or reviewing existing ones on
Weblate.

For the time being, localized translations are only available for the
\"latest\" (development) branch, but should be suitable to learn how to
use stable Godot releases nevertheless.
