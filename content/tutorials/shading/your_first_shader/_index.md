Your first shader
=================

This tutorial series will walk you through writing your first shader. It
is intended for people who have very little prior experience with
shaders and want to get started with the basics. This tutorial will not
cover advanced topics and it is not comprehensive. For a comprehensive
and detailed overview of shaders in Godot see the
`Shading Reference Page <toc-shading-reference>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

\"What are shaders\" gives you a high-level overview of what shaders are
and how they fit into the rendering pipeline.

The \"your first shader\" tutorials walk you through the process of
writing a shader step-by-step.

For a more general introduction into shaders and the OpenGL Shading
Language, use [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com).
