Editor icons {#doc_editor_icons}
============

When a new class is created and exposed to scripting, the editor\'s
interface will display it with a default icon representing the base
class it inherits from. Yet in most cases it is recommended to create
icons for new classes to improve the user experience.

Creating icons
--------------

In order to create new icons, you first need a vector graphics editor
installed. For instance, you can use the open-source
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) editor.

Clone the `godot-design` repository containing all the original editor
icons:

> ``` {.sourceCode .bash}
> git clone https://github.com/godotengine/godot-design
> ```

The icons must be created in a vector graphics editor in `svg` format.
You can use `engine/icons/inkscape_template.svg` with default icon
properties already set up.

Once you\'re satisfied with the icon\'s design, save the icon in
`engine/icons/svg/` folder. But in order for the engine to automatically
pick up the icons, each icon\'s filename:

1.  Must be prefixed with `icon_`.
2.  `PascalCase` name should be converted to `snake_case`, so words are
    separated by `_` whenever case changes, and uppercase acronyms must
    also have all letters, numbers, and special characters separated as
    distinct words. Some examples:

      -------------------------------------------------------
      Name                 Filename
      -------------------- ----------------------------------
      `Polygon2D`          `icon_polygon_2_d.svg`

      `CSGPolygon`         `icon_c_s_g_polygon.svg`

      `CPUParticles2D`     `icon_c_p_u_particles_2_d.svg`

      `C#`                 `icon_c_#.svg`
      -------------------------------------------------------

Icon optimization
-----------------

Because the editor renders the `svg`\'s at runtime, they need to be
small in size, so they can be efficiently parsed. Editor icons must be
first optimized before being added to the engine, to do so:

1.  Add them to the `engine/icons/svg` folder.
2.  Run the `optimize.py` script. You must have the `scour` package
    installed:

    ``` {.sourceCode .bash}
    pip install scour
    cd godot-design/engine/icons && ./optimize.py
    ```

The optimized icons will be generated in the `engine/icons/optimized`
folder.

Integrating and sharing the icons
---------------------------------

If you\'re contributing to the engine itself, you should make a pull
request to add optimized icons to `godot/editor/icons` in the main
repository. Recompile the engine to make sure it does pick up new icons
for classes. Once merged, don\'t forget to add the original version of
the icons to the `godot-design` repository so that the icon can be
improved upon by other contributors.

It\'s also possible to create custom icons within a module. If you\'re
creating your own module and don\'t plan to integrate it with Godot, you
don\'t need to make a separate pull request for your icons to be
available within the editor as they can be self-contained.

For specific instructions on how to create module icons, refer to
`Creating custom module icons<doc_custom_module_icons>`{.interpreted-text

Troubleshooting
---------------

If icons don\'t appear in the editor make sure that:

1.  Each icon\'s filename matches the naming requirement as described
    previously.
2.  `modules/svg` is enabled (should be enabled by default). Without it,
    icons won\'t appear in the editor at all.
