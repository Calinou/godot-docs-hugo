Intro to shaders: 2D and 3D water {#doc_intro_to_shaders_water_workshop}
=================================

![](img/intro_to_shaders_water_godot_project.png)

In this hands-on video series, you will create your first water shaders
in 2D and in 3D. If you\'re new to shaders, you should start 2D, because
you need some basic understanding of the shading language, vertex and
fragment shaders, to build upon. 3D adds quite a bit of complexity when
it comes to writing shader programs, as you will see in the third video.

Download the source code
------------------------

Download the intro to shaders project here to follow along:
`2d_water_shader.zip <files/2d_water_shader.zip>`{.interpreted-text
role="download"}.

It comes with a [start]{.title-ref} folder to follow along with the 2D
tutorials, and an [end]{.title-ref} folder that contains the final code.

You will find the 3D water project on [this GitHub
repository](https://github.com/BastiaanOlij/shader_tutorial). We didn\'t
include it here, as it is a little heavy.
