Android in-app purchases {#doc_android_in_app_purchases}

Godot engine has integrated GooglePaymentsV3 module with which we can
implement in-app purchases in our game.

The Godot engine demo project repository has an android-iap example
project. It includes a gdscript interface for android IAP.

Check the repository here
<https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects>

Find the iap.gd script in

    godot-demo-projects/misc/android_iap

Add it to the Autoload list and name it as IAP so that we can reference
it anywhere in the game.

Getting the product details
---------------------------

When starting our game, we will need to get the item details from Google
such as the product price, description and localized price string etc.

    #First listen to the sku details update callback
    IAP.connect("sku_details_complete",self,"sku_details_complete")

    #Then ask google the details for these items
    IAP.sku_details_query(["pid1","pid2"]) #pid1 and pid2 are our product ids entered in Googleplay dashboard


    #This will be called when sku details are retrieved successfully
    func sku_details_complete():
        print(IAP.sku_details) #This will print the details as JSON format, refer the format in iap.gd
        print(IAP.sku_details["pid1"].price) #print formatted localized price

We can use the IAP details to display the title, price and/or
description on our shop scene.

Check if user purchased an item
-------------------------------

When starting our game, we can check if the user has purchased any
product. YOU SHOULD DO THIS ONLY AFTER 2/3 SECONDS AFTER YOUR GAME IS
LOADED. If we do this as the first thing when the game is launched, IAP
might not be initialized and our game will crash on start.

    #Add a listener first
    IAP.connect("has_purchased",self,"iap_has_purchased")
    IAP.request_purchased() #Ask Google for all purchased items

    #This will call for each and every user purchased products
    func iap_has_purchased(item_name):
        print(item_name) #print the name of purchased items

Google IAP policy says the game should restore the user\'s purchases if
the user replaces their phone or reinstalls the same app. We can use the
above code to check what products the user has purchased and we can make
our game respond accordingly.

Simple Purchase
---------------

We can put this purchase logic on a product\'s buy button.

    #First listen for purchase_success callback
    IAP.connect("purchase_success",self,"purchase_success_callback")

    #Then call purchase like this
    IAP.purchase("pid1") #replace pid1 with your product id
    IAP.purchase("pid2") #replace pid2 with your another product id

    #This function will be called when the purchase is a success
    func purchase_success_callback(item):
        print(item + " has purchased")

We can also implement other signals for the purchase flow and improve
the user experience as you needed.

`purchase_fail` - When the purchase is failed due to any reason

`purchase_cancel` - When the user cancels the purchase

`purchase_owned` - When the user already bought the product earlier

Consumables and Non-Consumables
-------------------------------

There are two types of products - consumables and non-consumables.
**Consumables** are purchased and used, for eg: healing potions which
can be purchased again and again. **Non-consumables** are one time
purchases, for eg: Level packs.

Google doesn\'t have this separation in their dashboard. If our product
is a consumable, and if a user has purchased it, it will not be
available for purchase until it is consumed. So we should call the
consume method for our consumables and don\'t call consume for your
non-consumables.

    IAP.connect("consume_success",self,"on_consume_success")
    IAP.consume("pid")

    func on_consume_success(item):
        print(item + " consumed")

If our game has only consumables, we don\'t have to do this. We can set
it to consume the item automatically after a purchase.

    IAP.set_auto_consume(true)

If our game has only non-consumables, we can

    IAP.set_auto_consume(false)

We should set the auto consume value only once when the game starts.

Testing
-------

If we add a gmail id as a tester in Google dashboard, that tester can
purchase items and they will not be charged. Another way to test IAP is
using redeem codes generated by us for our game because the purchase
flow is the same.

Third way of testing is in development side. If we put the product ids
as shown below, we will get a static fixed response according to the
product id. This is a quick way of testing things before going to the
dashboard.

-   android.test.purchased
-   android.test.canceled
-   android.test.refunded
-   android.test.item\_unavailable
