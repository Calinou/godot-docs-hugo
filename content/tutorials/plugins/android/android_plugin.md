Creating Android plugins (Godot 4.0+) {#doc_android_plugin}
=====================================

Introduction
------------

Android plugins are powerful tools to extend the capabilities of the
Godot engine by tapping into the functionality provided by the Android
platform and ecosystem.

Mobile gaming monetization is one such example since it requires
features and capabilities that don\'t belong to the core feature set of
a game engine:

-   Analytics
-   In-app purchases
-   Receipt validation
-   Install tracking
-   Ads
-   Video ads
-   Cross-promotion
-   In-game soft & hard currencies
-   Promo codes
-   A/B testing
-   Login
-   Cloud saves
-   Leaderboards and scores
-   User support & feedback
-   Posting to Facebook, Twitter, etc.
-   Push notifications

Making modifications to the Android export template is another use-case
since using a plugin for that task allows the project to remain
compatible with newer Godot versions.

Android plugin
--------------

While introduced in Godot 3.2.0, the Android plugin system got a
significant architecture update starting with Godot 3.2.2. In Godot 4.0,
the new architecture became the default, rendering plugins for Godot
3.2.0 incompatible with Godot 4.0.

As a prerequisite, make sure you understand how to set up a
`custom build environment<doc_android_custom_build>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} for Android.

At its core, a Godot Android plugin is a [Android archive
library](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library#aar-contents)
(*aar* archive file) with the following caveats:

-   The library must have a dependency on the Godot engine library
    (`godot-lib.x.y.aar`). A stable version is made available for each
    Godot release.
-   The library must include a specifically configured `<meta-data>` tag
    in its manifest file.

### Building a Android plugin

**Prerequisite:** [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
is strongly recommended as the IDE to use to create Android plugins. The
instructions below assumes that you\'re using Android Studio.

1.  Follow [these
    instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library)
    to create an Android library module for your plugin.
2.  Add the Godot engine library as a dependency to your plugin module:
    -   Download the Godot engine library (godot-lib.x.y.aar)
    -   Follow [these
        instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/android-library#AddDependency)
        to add the Godot engine library as a dependency for your plugin.
    -   In the plugin module\'s `build.gradle` file, replace
        `implementation` with `compileOnly` for the dependency line for
        the Godot engine library.
3.  Create a new class in the plugin module and make sure it extends
    `org.godotengine.godot.plugin.GodotPlugin`. At runtime, it will be
    used to instantiate a singleton object that will be used by the
    Godot engine to load, initialize and run the plugin.
4.  Update the plugin `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
    -   Open the plugin `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
    -   Add the `<application></application>` tag if it\'s missing.
    -   In the `<application>` tag, add a `<meta-data>` tag setup as
        follow:

            <meta-data 
                android:name="org.godotengine.plugin.v1.[PluginName]" 
                android:value="[plugin.init.ClassFullName]" />

        Where `PluginName` is the name of the plugin, and
        `plugin.init.ClassFullName` is the full name (package + class
        name) of the plugin loading class.

5.  Add the remaining logic for your plugin and run the `gradlew build`
    command to generate the plugin\'s `aar` file. The build will likely
    generate both a `debug` and `release` `aar` files. Depending on your
    need, pick only one version (usually the `release` one) which to
    provide your users with.

**Note:** The plugin\'s `aar` filename must match the following pattern:
`[PluginName]*.aar` where `PluginName` is the name of the plugin in
camel case (e.g: `GodotPayment.release.aar`).

### Loading and using a Android plugin

Once you have access to the plugin `aar` file, move it to the Godot
project `res://android/plugins` directory.

From your script:

    if Engine.has_singleton("MyPlugin"):
        var singleton = Engine.get_singleton("MyPlugin")
        print(singleton.myPluginFunction("World"))

**When exporting the project**, you need to add the plugin\'s name to
the `Custom Template` -\> `Plugins` section. If trying to add multiple
plugins, separate their names by a comma (`,`).

### Bundling GDNative resources

A Android plugin can define and provide C/C++ GDNative resources, either
to provide and/or access functionality from the game logic. The GDNative
resources can be bundled within the plugin `aar` file which simplifies
the distribution and deployment process:

> -   The shared libraries (`.so`) for the defined GDNative libraries
>     will be automatically bundled by the `aar` build system.
> -   Godot `*.gdnlib` and `*.gdns` resource files must be manually
>     defined in the plugin `assets` directory. The recommended path for
>     these resources relative to the `assets` directory should be:
>     `godot/plugin/v1/[PluginName]/`.

For GDNative libraries, the plugin singleton object must override the
`org.godotengine.godot.plugin.GodotPlugin::getPluginGDNativeLibrariesPaths()`
method, and return the paths to the bundled GDNative libraries config
files (`*.gdnlib`). The paths must be relative to the `assets`
directory. At runtime, the plugin will provide these paths to Godot core
which will use them to load and initialize the bundled GDNative
libraries.

Troubleshooting
---------------

### Godot crashes upon load

Check `adb logcat` for possible problems, then:

-   Check that the methods used in the Java singleton only use simple
    Java datatypes. More complex datatypes are not supported.
