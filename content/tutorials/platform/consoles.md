Console support in Godot {#doc_consoles}
========================

Official support
----------------

Godot currently does not officially support consoles (except the Xbox
One using UWP).

The reasons for this are:

-   To develop for consoles, one must be licensed as a company. As an
    open source project, Godot does not have such a legal figure.
-   Console SDKs are secret and covered by non-disclosure agreements.
    Even if we could get access to them, we could not publish the
    platform-specific code under an open source license.
-   Consoles require specialized hardware to develop for, so regular
    individuals can\'t create games for them anyway.

However, it is still possible to port your games to consoles thanks to
services provided by third-party companies.

Third-party support
-------------------

Console ports of Godot are offered by third-party companies (which have
ported Godot on their own). These companies also offer publishing of
your games to various consoles.

Following is the list of providers:

-   [Lone Wolf Technology](http://www.lonewolftechnology.com/) offers
    Switch, PS4 and Xbox One porting and publishing of Godot games.
-   [Pineapple Works](https://pineapple.works/) offers Switch and Xbox
    One porting and publishing of Godot games.

If your company offers porting and/or publishing services for Godot
games, feel free to [open an issue or pull
request](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs) to add your company
to the list above.
