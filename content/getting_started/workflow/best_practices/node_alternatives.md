When and how to avoid using nodes for everything {#doc_node_alternatives}
================================================

Nodes are cheap to produce, but even they have their limits. A project
may have tens of thousands of nodes all doing things. The more complex
their behavior though, the larger the strain each one adds to a
project\'s performance.

Godot provides more lightweight objects for creating APIs which nodes
use. Be sure to keep these in mind as options when designing how you
wish to build your project\'s features.

1.  `Object <class_Object>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}: The ultimate
    lightweight object, the original Object must use manual memory
    management. With that said, it isn\'t too difficult to create one\'s
    own custom data structures, even node structures, that are also
    lighter than the `Node <class_Node>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    class.

    -   **Example:** See the `Tree <class_Tree>`{.interpreted-text
        role="ref"} node. It supports a high level of customization for
        a table of content with an arbitrary number of rows and columns.
        The data that it uses to generate its visualization though is
        actually a tree of `TreeItem <class_TreeItem>`{.interpreted-text
        role="ref"} Objects.
    -   **Advantages:** Simplifying one\'s API to smaller scoped objects
        helps improve its accessibility improve iteration time. Rather
        than working with the entire Node library, one creates an
        abbreviated set of Objects from which a node can generate and
        manage the appropriate sub-nodes.

    One should be careful when handling them. One can store an Object
    into a variable, but these references can become invalid without
    warning. For example, if the object\'s creator decides to delete it
    out of nowhere, this would trigger an error state when one next
    accesses it.

2.  `Reference <class_Reference>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}: Only a
    little more complex than Object. They track references to
    themselves, only deleting loaded memory when no further references
    to themselves exist. These are useful in the majority of cases where
    one needs data in a custom class.
    -   **Example:** See the `File <class_File>`{.interpreted-text
        role="ref"} object. It functions just like a regular Object
        except that one need not delete it themselves.
    -   **Advantages:** same as the Object.
3.  `Resource <class_Resource>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}: Only
    slightly more complex than Reference. They have the innate ability
    to serialize/deserialize (i.e. save and load) their object
    properties to/from Godot resource files.
    -   **Example:** Scripts, PackedScene (for scene files), and other
        types like each of the
        `AudioEffect <class_AudioEffect>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
        classes. Each of these can be save and loaded, therefore they
        extend from Resource.
    -   **Advantages:** Much has
        `already been said <doc_resources>`{.interpreted-text
        role="ref"} on `Resource <class_Resource>`{.interpreted-text
        role="ref"}\'s advantages over traditional data storage methods.
        In the context of using Resources over Nodes though, their main
        advantage is in Inspector-compatibility. While nearly as
        lightweight as Object/Reference, they can still display and
        export properties in the Inspector. This allows them to fulfill
        a purpose much like sub-Nodes on the usability front, but also
        improve performance if one plans to have many such
        Resources/Nodes in their scenes.
